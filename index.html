        My name is Hilary Scott and I was born in Annapolis, Maryland. I've lived in Georgia since I was 10 years old, 
        and after graduating from Georgia Tech in 2012, I worked at a local startup - where I really found an interest
        in learning the backend of the products and working directly with Engineering. I started working for Salesforce 
        (my dream job) in 2015 on the Support Team. I've learned a ton of techincal things in the last 4 years, but feel 
        like I've just hit the tip of the iceberg!

        I married my best friend in 2015 and after living in California for 3 years, we just moved back to Georgia
        last summer - where we bought our new dream house. We have 2 corgis (one who we rescuved out in CA), named Bubsy (8)
        and Webster (6). Here they are while on one of our favorite beach trips. 

        I enjoy being outside, working out, playing tennis, spending time with my nephews, live music, and 
        binge-watching Netflix shows and movies.
